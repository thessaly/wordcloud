There’s a, um, and so, you know, one of the big things is a lot of Standard components, we think of a standard and easy to get, like the frames that you bolt together, the printers and all sorts of things are made of. You can’t get out there. I hadn’t. So if you’re trying to build something out there, you need people to weld it together. If you try and get something welded together in England, hardly anyone welds anymore apart from in big businesses. So there’s this sort of, or at least at university, so there’s, there’s this sort of divide of skills. If you want something made well in Tanzania you’d probably want it welded. Whereas here you want to bolt together these alluminium extrusions. So it’s sort of, and this is a slightly different way of making things. What was interesting to us, um, was a lot of people came. So I think how I remember the exact name of it. It was, it was not computer science, but it was, it was like a computer. I think computer engineering degree was both grace and Valarian’s degree, which to us sounds like it would involve a lot of programming. And so I think coming into the project we expected a much higher degree of programming skills from STIC lab than they had just because of their CV, whereas it was much more a bit of electronics with general engineering, which, um, I mean Valerian has done great things with the motor control board. Um, with the electronics for that, some of which, uh, electric stuff he already knew, some of which he learned while he was in Cambridge. Um, but yeah, I, in terms of getting something made in sort of a more traditional, got it with the hats all welded together way, they’re incredibly skilled. A lot of the most sort of programming type stuff took, uh, some learning, but most of it has gone very well, except unfortunately there’s one CAD package that the microscope itself has been designed in that was quite difficult to get people on board with, which is a shame. The computerated design package for designing the microscope has been quite hard to get people really involved with"
